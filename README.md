# Console Rendering API

**Note:** This is an uniwersity project aimed at gaining an understanding of how rendering works. The code is not optimized due to the low resolution and the minimal number of objects present in the scene.

For instance, figures are represented as objects, and each point is defined for each polygon, even if two polygons share the same point. Please note that this code will not be optimized or updated.

## Compilation Instructions

I use **clang++** for compiling the project.

To compile the code, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
src/clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp
```
